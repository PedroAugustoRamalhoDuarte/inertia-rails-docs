# JavaScript apps the monolith way

> **Note**
> Inspired from official documentation of [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)

Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. We call it the modern monolith.

Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes with modern
SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.

Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build controllers and page views like you've
always done! Inertia works great with any backend framework.

## Not a framework

Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement for your existing server-side or client-side frameworks. Rather, it's
designed to work with them. Think of Inertia as glue that connects the two. Inertia does this via adapters. We currently
have three official client-side adapters (React, Vue, and Svelte) and two server-side adapters (Laravel and Rails).
